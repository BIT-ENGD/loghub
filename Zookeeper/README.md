## ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper (https://zookeeper.apache.org) is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. The log set was collected by aggregating logs from the ZooKeeper service in our lab at CUHK, which comprises a total of 32 machines. The logs cover a time period of 26+ days.
